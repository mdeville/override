Two ways to achive this:

Either you do it the stupid way (what is asked by the subject) and reverse the whole binary.


Or you catch the ptrace syscall with gdb and make it return 0.
See: https://gist.github.com/poxyran/71a993d292eee10e95b4ff87066ea8f2

Then you can set a breakpoint before the final cmp and see what value the program is expecting for a specific input:
login: abcdefg
serial: 6233754
OR
login: rbaraud
serial: 6231026
